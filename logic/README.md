ALWAYS USE THE LATEST PROTO FILE!!!

query2 - basic cutoff with MAC (MAC)
query3 - added DAC (MAC+DAC)
query4 - added CAP (MAC+DAC+CAP)
query5 - added EXT (MAC+DAC+CAP+EXT)

NOTE: query5 should only be used for external attack surface study.
Even the wildcard on EXT will assume a starting node from an object.
